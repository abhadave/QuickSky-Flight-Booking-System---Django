      Our Story
    </h2>
    
    <p class="mb-3">
      Back in the 90s, booking a ticket meant going all the way to the airport
      and standing in long queues waiting for your turn. Then came the internet,
      and everything changed. People could book their tickets online. Despite
      ongoing restrictions, travel has become more affordable than ever before.
      2018 saw approximately 2 billion trips by Indian travellers.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      However, the travel experience has remained largely unchanged – travel is
      still chaotic and uncertain. People still have bad trips.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      We discovered that this is largely due to information asymmetry. Travellers
      generally have to work hard to find information that concerns their trip.
      Travel is very information rich, but the information resides with different
      stakeholders and often doesn't reach the traveller in time – thus resulting
      in frustration, anger, and unpleasantness.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Today, we make bookings without a clear idea of what our trip is going to
      be like – what time we’ll leave home, what time we’ll reach our destination,
      and how comfortable we’ll be while we get this trip. On the day of the trip,
      we still frantically search for a cab, get nervous when we encounter traffic,
      and run to the boarding gate to get there on-time.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      We felt that there's got to be a better way. So, we built 
      <strong class="text-danger">Blinctrip</strong> – your personal travel assistant 
      that watches your trip experience and mindfully delivers the right information 
      to you at the right time. That means no more running.
